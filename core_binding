Assign thread to core.


cpu_set_t affinity;
CPU_ZERO(&affinity);
CPU_SET(core, &aff);
pthread_setaffinity_np(thread_id, sizeof(cpu_set_t), &affinity);

       The pthread_setaffinity_np() function sets the CPU affinity mask
       of the thread thread to the CPU set pointed to by cpuset.  If the
       call is successful, and the thread is not currently running on
       one of the CPUs in cpuset, then it is migrated to one of those
       CPUs.
       
       A thread's CPU affinity mask determines the set of CPUs on which
       it is eligible to run.  On a multiprocessor system, setting the
       CPU affinity mask can be used to obtain performance benefits.
       For example, by dedicating one CPU to a particular thread (i.e.,
       setting the affinity mask of that thread to specify a single CPU,
       and setting the affinity mask of all other threads to exclude
       that CPU), it is possible to ensure maximum execution speed for
       that thread.  Restricting a thread to run on a single CPU also
       avoids the performance cost caused by the cache invalidation that
       occurs when a thread ceases to execute on one CPU and then
       recommences execution on a different CPU.
